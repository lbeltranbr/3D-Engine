3D Rendering engine based on the book "3D Game Engine Development" by Franc Pouhela.

I have used the book as a starting point to develop my own rendering engine, so the code will differ in some parts. 
For now I'm working on basic Forward and Deferred rendering, PBR, and some post-process.
In the future I wat to optimize the code and add newer techniques starting with Real-time Raytracing.

Standard Overview of the current state of the engine:
